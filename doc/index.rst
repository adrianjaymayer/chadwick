Command-line tools
==================

Chadwick provides the following command-line programs for extracting
information from Retrosheet play-by-play event files:

- :ref:`cwevent <cwtools.cwevent>`, an expanded event
  descriptor, which replaces and extends the DiamondWare program
  BEVENT.

- :ref:`cwgame <cwtools.cwgame>`, a game information
  extractor, which replaces and extends the DiamondWare program
  BGAME.

- :program:`cwbox`, a boxscore generator, which
  replaces and extends the DiamondWare program BOX.

- :program:`cwdaily`, which produces day-by-day player statistical
  totals.  This program is unique to Chadwick.
  
- :ref:`cwsub <cwtools.cwsub>`, which extracts information
  about in-game player substitutions. This program is unique to
  Chadwick.

- :program:`cwcomment`, which extracts comment
  fields from event files. This program is unique to Chadwick.

This documentation is intended to be read in conjunction with the 
materials provided by Retrosheet (see
https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm)
summarizing the contents of
play-by-play files and operation of the DiamondWare versions of these
tools.  The Chadwick documentation focuses on filling in gaps in the
Retrosheet documentation, and on detailing Chadwick-specific
extensions the toolset.
